# Wordpress Startline #

A template on which you can build a custom Wordpress theme. It's only slightly opinionated, with relatively few features and no styling, just a simple baseline for standards-compliant, semantic, accessible blog markup.

## Todo

- Add custom comment form (with HTML5 input types)
- Add Microdata to markup
- Add Microformats 2 to markup
