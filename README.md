# Wordpress Startline #

A template on which you can build a custom Wordpress theme, containing only good markup with structured data.

## Purpose

This theme template should be useful if you're building a blog or blog-centric site with WordPress, but want to start with as blank a slate as possible rather than peeling back the parts you don't need from one of the bundled themes. The markup is designed to be semantic but minimal, so you can customise it and add your desired classnames. There's no CSS or JavaScript --- this is for people who'll want to do that themselves from scratch.

## Features

- Plain, concise wording where words are required
- Valid, accessible HTML5 markup
- Microdata attributes for posts, pages and comments
- Microformats 2 classnames for posts
- Clean, customisable markup for comment form and comments
- `img` tags without unnecessary `align`, `width` and `height` attributes
- Links without unnecessary `title` attributes
